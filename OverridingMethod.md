Overriding a method
Overriding a method is when you create a method on a subclass, which has the same signature as a method on a super class.
You override a parent class method, when you want the child class to show different behavior for that method.
The overridden method can do one of three things: 
It can implement completely different behavior, overriding the behavior of the parent.
It can simply call the parent class's method, which is somewhat redundant to do.
Or the method can call the parent class's method, and include other code to run, so it can extend the functionality for the Dog, for that behavior.

```java
public class Animal {

    private String type;
    private String size;
    private double weight;

    public Animal() {

    }

    public Animal(String type, String size, double weight) {
        this.type = type;
        this.size = size;
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Animal{" +
                "type='" + type + '\'' +
                ", size='" + size + '\'' +
                ", weight=" + weight +
                '}';
    }

    public void move(String speed) {
        System.out.println(type + " moves " + speed);
    }

    public void makeNoise() {
        System.out.println(type + " makes some kind of noise");
    }
}

```
```java
public class Dog extends Animal {

    private String earShape;
    private String tailShape;

    public Dog() {
        super("Mutt", "Big", 50);
    }

    public Dog(String type, double weight) {
        this(type, weight, "Perky", "Curled");
    }

    public Dog(String type, double weight, String earShape, String tailShape) {
        super(type, weight <  15 ? "small" : (weight < 35 ? "medium" : "large"),
                weight);
        this.earShape = earShape;
        this.tailShape = tailShape;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Dog{" +
                "earShape='" + earShape + '\'' +
                ", tailShape='" + tailShape + '\'' +
                "} " + super.toString();
    }

    public void makeNoise() {

    }

    @Override
    public void move(String speed) {
        super.move(speed);
        System.out.println("Dogs walk, run and wag their tail");
    }
}
```
```java
public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Animal animal = new Animal("Generic Animal", "Huge", 400);
        doAnimalStuff(animal, "slow");

        Dog dog = new Dog();
        doAnimalStuff(dog, "fast");

        Dog yorkie = new Dog("Yorkie", 15);
        doAnimalStuff(yorkie, "fast");
        Dog retriever = new Dog("Labrador Retriever", 65,
                "Floppy", "Swimmer");
        doAnimalStuff(retriever, "slow");
    }

    public static void doAnimalStuff(Animal animal, String speed) {

        animal.makeNoise();
        animal.move(speed);
        System.out.println(animal);
        System.out.println("_ _ _ _");
    }
}
