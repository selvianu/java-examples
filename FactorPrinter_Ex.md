#### All Factors
Write a method named printFactors with one parameter of type int named number. 

If number is < 1, the method should print "Invalid Value".

The method should print all factors of the number. A factor of a number is an integer which divides that number wholly (i.e. without leaving a remainder).

For example, 3 is a factor of 6 because 3 fully divides 6 without leaving a remainder. In other words 6 / 3 = 2.

##### EXAMPLE INPUT/OUTPUT:

printFactors(6); → should print 1 2 3 6

printFactors(32); → should print 1 2 4 8 16 32

printFactors(10); → should print 1 2 5 10

printFactors(-1); → should print "Invalid Value" since number is < 1
